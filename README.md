### Hello! 👋

I am Tainá, a brazilian aspiring Web Software Developer from Salvador 🏖️. I am calm and shy, but really like getting to know new people and connect with them. When I am not programming, I'll definaly be spending time with my family 👫, watching some good anime/k-drama 📺 or thinking about the misteries of life/universe 🤔.

I discovered programming world through electronics and got enchanted by seeing my own code running for the first time ✨. I am currently learning the bases of full stack software development at [Trybe](https://github.com/betrybe) and seeking to build complete aplications that will be helpful to other people 👩‍💻.
