## Hello! 👋

I am Tainá, a brazilian aspiring Web Software Developer from Salvador 🏖️. I am calm and shy, but really like getting to know new people and connect with them. When I am not programming, I'll definaly be spending time with my loved ones 👫, watching some good anime/k-drama 📺 or thinking about the misteries of life/universe 🤔.

*Seeking for knowledge, currently studying at [Trybe](https://github.com/betrybe) 👩‍💻 and willing to do some good in the world* ✨.
